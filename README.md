## Visionary Genius Academy Art Gallery

Visionary Genius Academy Art Gallery was built using HTML, CSS, JS with Aframe. Aframe is a web framework for 3d/AR/VR experiences. The goal was to learn the framework of Aframe while seeing the capabilities of what it has in store. Media was designed by myself then placed in the actual world. More digitial artwork will be displayed as the scene is built.
